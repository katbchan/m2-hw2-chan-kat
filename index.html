<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="kakaoneo.jpg" alt="Neo Eating & Excercising">
<p>My name is Kat (just Kat, not short for anything) and I am located in Orlando, FL. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling and spending time with my family. I am also a Swiftie and like to obnoxiously quote Taylor Swift lyrics.</p>
<h2>Interest/Hobbies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I love traveling and exploring destinations and cultures.</li>
  <li>A foodie, I'm always on the lookout for new dining experiences and flavors.</li>
  <li>While not into physical activities much, I am a moderate gym goer and learning tennis as a beginner.</li>
</ul>  
<h2>Career Goal</h2>
<P>I desire to transition from my current path in the legal field to a more innovative and progressive industry. Since coding is integral to so many areas, Iâ€™m also open to exploring how these skills could help me transition into a different, tech-focused position within the legal field itself.</p>
